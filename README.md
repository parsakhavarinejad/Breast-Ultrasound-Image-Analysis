# Breast Ultrasound Image Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates various tasks related to breast ultrasound image analysis using deep learning techniques. The notebook combines code for image segmentation, classification, compression, reconstruction, and generation.

## Tasks Covered
1. **Image Segmentation with UNet**
2. **Image Classification with VGG16, VGG19, EfficientNet**
   - Transfer Learning and Fine-tuning
3. **Image Compression and Reconstruction with AutoEncoder**
4. **Image Generation with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)**

## Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook is sourced from [Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset) on Kaggle.
